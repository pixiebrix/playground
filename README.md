# playground

> Playground for testing extensions and web customization.

Base demo page available at: https://pixiebrix.github.io/playground/example/

## Usage suggestions

1. Create a folder at the root of the repo
2. Place an index.html in it (you can copy `example/index.html` if it's useful)
3. Access it at `https://pixiebrix.github.io/playground/YOUR_FOLDER_NAME/`
4. No rules at this point, but try not to edit previous content (it may be used as automated testing ground as well)
